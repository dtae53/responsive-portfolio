      <h1>About Me</h1> 

      <img src="assets/images/face.png" class="auth-image" alt="Davontae Glenn">

      <p>Currently a student in the University of Washington’s Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp looking to become a full-time developer. My passion is in sports and technology with extensive experience in both industries as an IT Support Engineer. More importantly, I understand how technology and sports correlate as I’ve worked in several sporting organizations including the University of Washington Intercollegiate Athletics, Pac-12 Conference/Networks, and now the Seattle Mariners. I believe my training, experience, and proven ability in my current and previous positions will allow me to significantly contribute to any group or organization.</p>

      <p>I currently reside in West Seattle and have lived in the state of Washington for the majority of my life. While not occupied with work or my web development studies, my hobbies include gaming and participating in recreational sports. I enjoy playing Madden and NBA 2K. I partake in pickup basketball games at local basketball gyms and play in flag football leagues with my friends on the weekends. I’m a very active person and try to stay as busy as possible even in my spare time.</p>
